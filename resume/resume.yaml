  summary: |
    As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, I utilize a strong background in Java-based backend 
    services combined with extensive experience in modern frontend technologies. My recent 
    shift to fullstack development allows me to apply my thorough knowledge of the Java Platform
    and harness the capabilities of the Angular framework to create interactive and 
    responsive user interfaces.

    Testing continues to be a critical component of my development process. I am proficient 
    in systematic unit testing and adept at using advanced integration tools such as 
    Cypress and Playwright, which are essential for thorough application testing and 
    effective backend simulation.

    ### Specialties

    Strong expertise in Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Comprehensive experience in 
    backend technologies, including Java, Spring, Hibernate, Web Services, and Cloud 
    Computing. My approach focuses on integrating innovative frontend techniques with 
    robust backend solutions to deliver superior outcomes for clients.
